# Drivers-Dizziness-Detection-in-Python
We propose a system that alerts the driver whenever he feels drowsy. It takes facial features as input from the live recording through a webcam and then process each frame from the video using OpenCV and the mathematical calculations between two eye lids and alert the driver with an audio alert. We use Tkinter, CV2, dlib, Scipy and PyGame modules.
